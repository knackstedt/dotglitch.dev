<!--
    Context menus are for right-mouse click events and
    touchscreen long-touch events.
 -->
<button mat-stroked-button [ngx-ctx-menu]="ctxMenu">Right click me</button>

<!--
    Additionally, we may want to handle left-clicks through a
    button in addition to a context menu (as context menus)
    aren't normative in web applications
 -->
<button mat-stroked-button [ngx-app-menu]="ctxMenu">Left click me</button>

<!--
    We can also add different handlers, essentially anything that is an event.
    Here we set a dblclick handler, and a context menu handler.
 -->
<button
    mat-stroked-button
    [ngx-app-menu]="ctxMenu"
    [ngx-app-menu-config]="{
        trigger: ['dblclick', 'contextmenu']
    }"
>
    Double click or right click me
</button>
